summary: "A Markov chain analysis of academic mobility patterns revealing how university reputation influences researchers' career trajectories and institutional barriers to mobility."

abstract: "Researchers, during all their careers, face significant barriers (e.g., Glass ceiling and gender pay gap) that limit their career development. This paper focuses on the idea that there exists a barrier given by academic affiliations. So, we analyze how the reputation of the university to which an academic is initially affiliated influences his/her career development. The data used to track professional careers year by year come from the ORCID database, which cover more than 3.8 million individuals. Whilst, university's global ranking is used to qualify the university standing. In this sense, per each year, the best university in the world is ranked 1 and the last N, with N equal to the number of university or classes used. A sample of the ORCID data is used to obtain the transition probability of moving from one university to another, revealing how academic reputation influences researchers' career trajectories. We perform a set of evaluations using Markov chains based on ranking and years. This study presents the career realizations of thousands of colleagues, proving difficulties in moving from high and low ranked universities and presenting some ideas on how to tackle such an issue."

This presentation explores the complex dynamics of international academic mobility using advanced Markov chain modeling to analyze career trajectories of researchers across different university rankings and institutional affiliations.

**Research Objectives:**
- **Institutional Barriers:** Investigate how university reputation creates mobility barriers for researchers
- **Career Trajectories:** Analyze the influence of initial institutional affiliation on career development
- **Global Patterns:** Understand international mobility patterns across different university rankings
- **Policy Implications:** Provide insights for addressing mobility inequalities in academia

**Methodology:**
- **Large-Scale Data:** Analysis of 3.8+ million individual records from ORCID database
- **University Rankings:** Global ranking system to classify institutional standing
- **Markov Chain Modeling:** Transition probability analysis for inter-institutional mobility
- **Longitudinal Analysis:** Year-by-year career tracking and trajectory modeling

**Key Findings:**
- **Mobility Constraints:** Evidence of significant barriers between high and low-ranked institutions
- **Career Persistence:** Strong influence of initial institutional affiliation on career development
- **Transition Patterns:** Systematic analysis of movement probabilities across university rankings
- **Global Inequalities:** Documentation of institutional hierarchies affecting researcher mobility

**Data and Methods:**
- **ORCID Database:** Comprehensive researcher career tracking across millions of academics
- **Ranking Integration:** Global university ranking data for institutional classification
- **Statistical Framework:** Markov chain transition matrices and probability analysis
- **Temporal Analysis:** Multi-year career progression and mobility patterns

**Academic Impact:**
This research contributes to understanding systemic inequalities in academic career development and provides empirical evidence for policy interventions to improve researcher mobility and career equity across institutional hierarchies.

**Collaborative Research:**
Joint work with Vincenzo Scardigno, demonstrating interdisciplinary collaboration in applying quantitative methods to higher education research and academic career analysis.

## About Me

Hi there! I am Valerio Ficcadenti â€” welcome to my corner of the web!

I teach research methods mostly, working with around 500 students each year as they approach the end of their academic journey, writing their theses. Together, we explore socio-economic phenomena through cool datasets, fostering curiosity in business and management science.

My journey spans academia, industry, and even local level policy making, where I have learned that even small decisions can make a big difference.

I am especially proud to have studied Informatics at [Technical Industrial Institute "G. and M. Montani"](https://www.istitutomontani.edu.it/web/storia/), a place that shaped me and introduced me to lifelong friends.

Outside work, you will find me cycling ðŸš´, kickboxing ðŸ¥Š (black belt!), diving into geopolitical news ðŸ“°, or battling it out in board games ðŸŽ² like Catan.

Vincenzo Scardigno is a visiting PhD student from the University of Bari, Italy, currently conducting research at London South Bank University under the supervision of Dr. Valerio Ficcadenti and Ass. Prof. Mariantonietta Intonti.

His research specializes in academic mobility analysis and higher education studies, with a particular focus on understanding the dynamics of researcher career development and institutional barriers in academic progression. He combines statistical modeling techniques, including Markov chain analysis, with large-scale data analysis to investigate patterns of international academic mobility.

His current work examines how institutional reputation and university rankings affect researcher career trajectories, utilizing comprehensive datasets such as ORCID to track professional careers and analyze transition probabilities between institutions. This research contributes to understanding systemic inequalities in academic career development and provides empirical evidence for policy interventions to improve researcher mobility and career equity across institutional hierarchies.

I am honored to announce that in June 2025, I have been elected by my colleagues for the second time as Business School representative on the [Academic Board of London South Bank University](https://www.lsbu.ac.uk/about-us/people/governance/academic-board).

This re-election represents not only a personal honor but also a continued opportunity to contribute to the strategic academic direction of the university. As a member of the Academic Board, I will continue to advocate for excellence in teaching, research, and the overall academic experience for our students and faculty within the Business School.

The Academic Board plays a crucial role in:
- Setting academic standards and quality assurance
- Approving new academic programs and courses
- Overseeing research strategy and policy
- Ensuring the university maintains its commitment to academic excellence

I look forward to working alongside my fellow board members to support LSBU's mission of providing transformative education and advancing knowledge through research and innovation.

Thank you to my colleagues for their continued trust and support. I am committed to representing the interests and perspectives of the Business School community effectively in this important governance role.

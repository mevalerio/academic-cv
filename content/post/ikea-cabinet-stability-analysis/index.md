# Abstract 🧑‍🔬

This study evaluates the stability of common IKEA cabinets when used without wall fixings. Focusing on white finish storage units with doors, we assess their stability through geometric proportions and tipping risk analysis. Using principles of static equilibrium, we compute the tipping angles under two scenarios: with doors closed and with doors open at 90 degrees.

# Introduction 🔍

In rented accommodation, wall fixings are often prohibited, making freestanding stability a critical criterion when selecting furniture. This analysis examines IKEA cabinets in terms of inherent stability, offering guidance based on measurable data rather than subjective perception.

## Methodology 🔧

### 1️⃣ Geometry Assessment

Height-to-depth ratio is a key indicator of stability:

- Shallow and tall = higher risk 🚩
- Deep and tall = greater inherent stability ✅

### 2️⃣ Centre of Gravity (CG) Shift Due to Open Doors 🚪

When a door opens to 90°, the centre of gravity (CG) shifts forward. This change reduces the tipping angle.

### 3️⃣ Calculation of Tipping Angle 📐

**Closed Doors:**
{{< math >}}$$\theta_{\text{tip}} = \arctan\left( \frac{\text{depth} / 2}{\text{height}} \right)$${{< /math >}}

**With One Door Open at 90°:**
{{< math >}}$$\theta_{\text{tip}} = \arctan\left( \frac{\text{depth} / 2 - \text{CG offset}}{\text{height}} \right)$${{< /math >}}

Where {{< math >}}$\text{CG offset}${{< /math >}} accounts for the horizontal shift of mass due to the open door.

# Discussion 🤓

## Depth as a Determinant of Stability

Deeper bases provide superior tipping resistance. Units below 40 cm depth present inherent risk in taller configurations.

| Depth (cm) | Product    | Interpretation                       |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ~30        | KNOXHULT   | Shallow and tall = high tipping risk |
| ~37        | HAVSTA     | Mid-height, shallow: caution advised |
| ~42        | BESTÅ      | Low = stable, tall = needs care      |
| ~58-62     | PAX, METOD | Tall and deep = inherently stable    |

# Recommendations 💡

| Use Case                  | Recommended Product             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Maximum stability, tall   | METOD / METOD VALLSTENA         |
| Wardrobe replacement      | PAX                             |
| Compact sideboard storage | BESTÅ Low                       |
| Budget-conscious option   | KNOXHULT (only with extra care) |

# Safety Considerations for Renters 🏠

| Product  | Best Practices                                                                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BESTÅ    | Heavy items low, level feet, anti-slip pads optional.                                    |
| PAX      | Load heavy items at the base, keep doors closed when not in use.                         |
| HAVSTA   | Heavier loads on lower shelves, avoid placing heavy items on top shelves.                |
| METOD    | Designed for kitchens; inherently stable without additional measures.                    |
| KNOXHULT | Avoid leaving doors open; weight only at the bottom; use anti-slip mats or tension rods. |

# Conclusion 📝

This analysis demonstrates that **depth is the key factor** in furniture stability for freestanding use. Tall cabinets under 40 cm depth pose a higher tipping risk unless secured. Kitchen-standard depths, as used in METOD systems, provide the best inherent safety.

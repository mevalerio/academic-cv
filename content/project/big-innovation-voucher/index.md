## üéØ Project Objectives

1. **Study the need for an infrastructure** hosted by [Crystalisr cooperative platform](https://www.crystalisr.coop/community-of-practice), aiming at enabling local SMEs to access procurement opportunities.
2. **Use text mining and AI technology** to analyse procurement calls and social value needs among Anchor Institutions (AIs).
3. **Investigate ‚Äòsocial tokens‚Äô** to incentivise community participation on the platform and improve democratic involvement in local economic development.
4. Contribute to **Community Wealth Building (CWB)** by connecting SMEs with public and private institutions via a digital marketplace.

## üìö Theoretical Framework

This project is grounded in the principles of **Community Wealth Building (CWB)**, a transformative approach to local economic development that seeks to democratise the economy and ensure that wealth generated in a place stays in that place. At its core, CWB leverages the influence of **Anchor Institutions**‚Äîsuch as universities, hospitals, and local authorities‚Äîto redirect investment, procurement, employment, and asset ownership in ways that promote inclusive and sustainable local prosperity.

### International Inspirations for Community Wealth Building

The project draws on internationally recognised models that have operationalised CWB principles in practice:

- **The Cleveland Model** (USA)  
  Developed by [The Democracy Collaborative](https://democracycollaborative.org), this model is centred on creating worker-owned cooperatives that serve the procurement needs of anchor institutions in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. It exemplifies CWB by institutionalising local hiring and democratic ownership structures, ensuring that the economic benefits of procurement circulate within the local community.

- **The Preston Model** (UK)  
  Led by [Preston City Council](https://www.preston.gov.uk), this UK-based adaptation of CWB focuses on progressive procurement, local investment, and the development of cooperative businesses. It demonstrates how public sector anchors can rewire their spending to support local supply chains, build community assets, and foster a resilient local economy.

- **Caja Laboral & Mondragon Corporation** (Spain)  
  Based in the Basque region, [Mondragon](https://www.mondragon-corporation.com/en/) represents a large-scale example of community-owned financial and industrial infrastructure. Caja Laboral, its cooperative bank, illustrates how local financial institutions can support long-term local development by aligning credit with social purpose, embodying CWB‚Äôs principle of **local financial stewardship**.

These cases showcase different but complementary pathways to building resilient local economies:  
- *Cleveland* demonstrates **worker ownership** and anchor-led demand for local services.  
- *Preston* highlights the power of **anchor procurement** and public policy.  
- *Mondragon* embodies **financial mutualism and cooperative enterprise** at scale.

CWB aims to redistribute wealth through **local procurement**, **living wage policies**, **municipal enterprise**, and **community-owned finance**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

- **Interpretivist approach** using qualitative data from semi-structured interviews.
- Conducted **9 interviews with 8 Anchor Institutions**, covering 58 questions (open-ended + Likert scale).
- Interviews explored: procurement strategies, software used, views on social value, and familiarity with CWB.
- Data was analysed using **thematic content analysis**.

## üìä Key Findings

- **Procurement is central**: 88.8% rated it as very or extremely important.
- **Market fragmentation**: There is no dominant platform. Tools used include Proactis, Delta eSourcing, ContractsFinder, and others.
- **Limited measurement of social value**: Half of the organisations do not assess it; those who do use informal metrics or tools like EcoVadis.
- **Support for local SMEs**: 75% stated local business support is important; 43% procure from SMEs over 100 times/year.
- **Barriers**: Anchors struggle to identify and contact local SMEs. They rely on passive registration systems, creating informational silos.
- **Brokerage need**: Crystalisr‚Äôs proposed brokerage service was welcomed to curate and connect prequalified SMEs with procurement needs.
- **Anchor Network**: All interviewees endorsed the creation of a cross-institutional Anchor Network to coordinate and share best practices.

## üß© Narrative Conclusions

- LSBU and Crystalisr successfully recorded the need for a **digital platform** to connect SMEs with Anchor Institutions.
- The **research confirmed the absence of a coherent anchor network** and high demand for a unifying solution.
- The **CWB framework** was embraced in theory, but implementation practices (e.g. social value metrics) remain underdeveloped.
- The **project validated the potential** for Crystalisr to lead brokerage, training, and matchmaking initiatives in South London.
- The study lays the groundwork for a **social barometer**, guiding the measurement and communication of social value in procurement.

## üöÄ Impact and Outputs

- **New Service**: Service design for community wealth building integrated into the [Crystalisr platform](https://www.crystalisr.coop).
- **Collaborations**: Established basis for the **[BIG Integrate](../big-integrate/)** project, building on the research findings to develop an integrated platform for community wealth building.

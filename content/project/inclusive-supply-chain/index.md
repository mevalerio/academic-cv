## Overview

The Inclusive Supply Chain (ISC) project emerged from the trajectory of work funded by **BIG South London**:

- The **BIG Innovation Voucher Scheme** tested how the Community Wealth Building framework could support South London SMEs to strengthen their supply chains and social value contributions while growing.
- The **BIG Integrate** project developed diagnostic tools to tailor help for SMEs, trainings to push SMEs ahead in their readiness, and to boost SMEs' capacity to supply large buyers, filling the gap in SMEs' readiness to bid.

Building on these foundations, the ISC programme scaled up under the **UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF)**, funded by the **Greater London Authority (GLA)**.

The programme was also framed within **Community Wealth Building (CWB)**, which seeks to redirect economic flows back into local communities. The ISC did this by supporting SMEs to access anchor-institution procurement opportunities, embedding EDI and social value into business practices, and fostering collaboration across South London.
